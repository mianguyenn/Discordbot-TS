# Discord-bot: Kirbo
A basic discord bot written in TypeScript. :partying_face: 	It's pretty easy to make it so no need to worry! 

Commands you can use:

>/ping: Bot will respond to you with a "Poyo" message. You can always change the message later if you want to. :laughing:

>/add: Bot will help you calculate muplication within seconds. You can always change to addition, subtraction or division later. 

Here's a brief guide on how to get started :wink::

**Step 1: Create your own Discord bot using this link [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)**.

**Step 2: Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)  and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**. You can use other code editors, it's up to your preferences. 

**Step 3: Install essential packages**

This bot's code contains these following packages: discord.js; dotenv; nodemon. 
```
npm init
npm install discord.js
npm install -g nodemon 
npm install dotenv
```
Install those by using Command Prompt (simply type "cmd" in your Windows search bar and you'll find it) **or** you can install those directly in your VSCode's Terminal. 

To check if those packages are already installed to your machine or not, simply browse through the file ```package.json```.

**Step 4: Follow the codes**

After step 3, you are good to go! You can add more slash commands to the bot, this is just a base code for a basic Discord bot. You can always make alterations. :grinning:

To run the code, you simply type "npm run dev" and it will automatically run the bot for you!

### :pushpin: A few advice for you: 
- Make sure to save the codes as soon as you finish coding (Ctrl+S).
- You don't need to pay attention to the ```package-lock.json``` file, just leave it there. :wink:
-	:warning: Few notes on TOKEN: You need to know what exactly is a TOKEN. So, a TOKEN is a specific code required to have your code access to your actual bot. You can check your bot's TOKEN right after you finish creating your bot in [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)<path: Applications/Bot>. You don't want to leak your bot's TOKEN to anyone, because they will have full access to your bot and make change to your bot afterwards, so be careful! I suggest you guys creating a ```.env``` file, and store your TOKEN there like this:
```TOKEN=your-token-goes-here```
- Whenever you encounter an error, it's okay! Seek for help in stackoverflow webpage. Most problems I encountered before, I always find my way to there. 
- Practice makes perfect: Don't give up yet, and try to figure out stuff. Coding path is just all about trials and errors, so it's a okay. :grinning:
